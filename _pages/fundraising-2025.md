The troop receives 48% commission on sales of Trails End Popcorn and Burger's meats. These funds can be used to support:

* Summer camp attendance: ~$600-$700 of sales can cover your scout's stay at Lake of the Ozarks Scout Reservation!
* Troop gear: at times we use funds to purchase troop gear like tents.
* Troop uniforms: funds also defray the costs of rank and merit badge patches. 
* Funds also defray other troop costs like the annual charter renewal. 


# Important Dates and other information

* **November 3rd.** Orders and money must be submitted to the troop leaders!
* **November 13th and 14th.** Final order pickup and distribution to scouts. 
* **KWM97** This is the 5 digit code needed to set up your scout with an online Trails End storefront, which is useful for non-local folks to support your scout. 
    * Note that there is a delivery fee for popcorn ordered from the online portal.
