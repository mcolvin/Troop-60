# The Outdoor Code

* As an American, I will do my best to
* Be clean in my outdoor manners
* Be careful with fire
* Be considerate in the outdoors
* Be conservation-minded

The Scouts will read the Outdoor Code and probably understand most of it. But adding in some
discussion points will help reinforce it. So below (and in the printable copy) I have not put some
discussion points after the code itself. Use these as a starting point for having a conversation
about what we can really do to minimize our impact when camping.


# The Outdoor Code

As an American I will do my best to

* Be clean in my outdoor manners
    * I will treat the outdoors as a heritage. 
    * I will take care of it for myself and others. 
    * I will keep my trash and garbage out of lakes, streams, fields, woods, and roadways.
* Be careful with fire
    * I will prevent wildfire. 
    * I will build my fires only where they are appropriate. 
    * When I have finished using a fire, I will make sure it is cold out. 
    * I will leave a clean fire ring or remove all evidence of my fire.
* Be considerate in the outdoors
    * I will treat public and private property with respect. 
    * I will use low-impact methods of hiking and camping. 
* Be conservation minded 
    * I will learn how to practice good conservation of soil, waters, forests, minerals, grasslands, wildlife, and energy. 
    * I will urge others to do the same.
